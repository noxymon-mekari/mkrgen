The mkrgen UI is a crucial component of the mkrgen ecosystem, providing a user-friendly interface for creating CLI commands and visualizing project structures.

By visiting the mkrgen UI website at [mkrgen.dev](https://mkrgen.dev), users can interact with a visual representation of their project setup before executing commands.
